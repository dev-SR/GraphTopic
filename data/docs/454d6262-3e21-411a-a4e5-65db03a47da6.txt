Credit Card Fraud Detection Techniques: A Comparative Analysis. In recent times, credit card payments are playing a crucial role in our day-to-day life applications. Despite its advantages, it also has certain fraud transaction challenges. Detection of fraudulent behavior demands high precision which might differ as per the payment method, country, and population segment. To achieve high precision of fraud detection existing resources should be reused smartly to remodel them in a divergent state of affairs given the big budget conventional systems. This paper explores several Machine Learning (ML) ensemble algorithms to monitor how accurate and precise they have been in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraudulent one. And then compared with existing algorithms on the different performance evaluation parameters..
